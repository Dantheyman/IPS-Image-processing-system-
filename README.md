
It is suggested that anyone who aims to train models on this system at least reads the yolov5 documentation as it will 
provide valuable insight to the user documentation can be found here https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 

# IPS-Image-processing-system-
The system can currently be used to train a model to detect trees, as well as automatically creating datasets and creating annotations. 


## Models
This system utilizes several models, firstly Sam2 segmentation and pre existing YOLOv8 detection models. 
They are not included in this repo and need to be downloaded/sourced separately

## Machine assumption
In the current system its expected that DMS and IPS are on the same machine, to allow separately, model and dataset interactions will need to be changed.
